A basic web server that can serve GET requests for HTTP 1.1. Written in C using sockets. Currently supports handling of HTML files, directory files, CGI scripts, photos, and gifs.
Part of this was completed as part of a final project for my CS410 class in collaboration with Daniel Katz and Dipesh Thapa.
